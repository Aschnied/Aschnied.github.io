      <div id="thoughts">We all know what stereotypes are; and we've all been exposed to them or even perpetuated one at some point or another.  We're not here to talk about the origins of, or solutions to stereotypes today.  We're going to talk about how they actually affect us when we learn.

      Claude M Steele is a social psychologist who is best known for working on the concept of Stereotype Threat.  The topic of stereotype threat is the concept involving an individual being aware of a negative stereotype that could be applied to them, and the way that affects their performance in an academic environment.  For example, telling a group of white males, before a math exam, that asian males are statistically better at math will negatively affect the performance of the white males.

      Now, I know that I'm not someone who people would consider having experienced stereotypical threats; but it's the worst kept secret in the world that I'm a homosexual. So I'm sure you can imagine that I've had to deal with/perpetuate/overcome a few stereotypes in my life. There are stereotypes out there that gay men are too emotional, or not good at sports, etc.  Going into a social situation amongst strangers that statistically heterosexual, I often find myself worried that I'll seem too gay, or that I'll not fit in with the straight guys.  I know that the tech industry is predominantly straight, as are most industries.  Going into a social situation and meeting groups of people I'm always concerned about not being included due to sexual orientation.  This is especially present in academic environments.  I find myself worried too much about being accepted by the group and not focused on learning.  This worry validates the stereotype threat.

      What could I do to alleviate this?  I try to find common ground.  Funny animal videos on the internet is a really good way to break down social barriers; everyone finds them funny.  Aside from that, I've come to find that just being myself and admitting that I probably won't have a lot in common is a great way to relax.  When guys start to talk about sports and then include me in the conversation I just politely state that I don't follow sports.  I don't mock sports, I just admit that I don't get it.  It's just not for me.

      Based on what I've learned (and I learned later than I wished) I can say that stereotypes only hurt if you let them.  We each hold the ability to defy or perpetuate a stereotype.  If you worry about the stereotype it will increase your chances that you will perpetuate it.  If you don't worry aobut it, chances are you'll defy it (and if you don't who cares? you're not worried about it!)
      <br>
      <br>
      We can't let ourselves validate stereotypes, because that makes the threat of them coming true greater.  We need to be better at not only ignoring stereotypes, but not repeating them.  Ideas begin with words, and what if someone never heard a stereotype about them?  That stereotype would never affect them.  They wouldn't doubt themselves, and stereotypes wouldn't be a threat to our success.
