      <div id="thoughts">If you work in tech, do me a favor; look around you.  Make a note of your coworkers' gender.  Kinda unblanced, right?  Now think about sexual preference.  How many of your coworkers openly identify as LGBT, how many of your coworkers or people you know in the tech industry identify as  different gender than you would guess?  Put all that into a larger picture, and you'll start to see that the tech industry could be considered a heterosexual boys club.

      I live in San Francisco, CA and arguably the center of the global tech industry.  Seeing the people lined up for the google buses, interacting with other residents, and having friends in the tech industry have shown me that there is a very apparent lack of diversity in tech.

      I'm not saying that this inherantly leads to a bad situation. Look at all that has been accomplished so far!  What I'm pointing out is that our achievments in tech can go even farther if we have a more diverse industry that can draw on unique perspectives.

      We start by trying to accept as broad a segment of the global population as we can when enrolling students; we reach out to communities not typically associated with tech.  Reaching out to children is also a great way to increase diversity. Newer generations are almost always more diverse than their predecessors.  We'd also reap the benefit of children growing up learning computer languages like we had to learn a Spanish, French, etc.

      So next time you're attending a tech related event, just take a quick look around and see who you're among.  If you think the crowd looks a little too homogenous, look into supporting a non-profit or school program that focuses on drafting a diverse student body.
