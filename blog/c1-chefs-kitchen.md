My thoughts on DBC

11.02.14

Today I watched a video from one of the founders of Dev Bootcamp, Shereef.  He basically went into the core principles of DBC and what a new attendee expects from the program will greatly determine their success.

Is my attitude focused on my purchase of DBC education, then presuming what the outcome of that purchase is?

Or am I going in with an open head, expecting to learn more than just coding?

After my initial understanding of DBC values and concepts, I confess I was a bit worried.  In my past I have shied away from people who have wanted me to really focus on how my brain works.  I really took to heart what Shereef said about going into DBC and letting the experience change me for the better.  I'm going to let my guards down (they haven't had a day off in 27 years) and really embrace the DBC culture to provide myself and others the best environment to learn in.

I am definitely nervous to become a part of such a large and diverse group of people. I hope that I can always give 100% compassion and understanding to everyone.

So let's hear it for my first week of Phase 0.  I have been working towards this for a long time now and I hope for the continued support of my friends, family, and fellow Squirrels.

Excelsior!
