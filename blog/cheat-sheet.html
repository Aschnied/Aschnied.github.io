        </div>

        <div id="leftcolumn">
          <p>Javascript is a most commonly used in web browsers.  Despite that being its primary function, it is a very robust language that supports object-oriented programming in addition to other formats.
          <br>
          <br>
          Real life objects can be represented in Javascript.  We even call them objects in Javascript.  Pizza is an object that comes in many different forms.  We know that there are dozens of toppings, and different kinds of crust, cheeses, and sauces.  It is possible to represent pizza in Javascript by designating it as an object.  All the variations of pizza are considered its properties.
          <br>
          <br>
          However, we know that a pizza has many other options, so we'll assign multiple values to a pizza.  This is called 'object literal' notation. The object can span multiple lines, so spaces and line breaks are not important.
          <br>
          <br>
          We can access object properties two ways:  objectName.propertyName or objectName[propertyName].
          <br>
          <br>
          Javascript objects can also have methods as properties. If you look on the right you will see the "placeOrder" method as a property of pizza.  If we were to continue our code below, we would define the method placeOrder.  We would access this by writing "pizza.placeOrder".
          <br>
          <br>
          The only thing we shouldn't do when creating objects is declare strings, numbers, and boleans as objects. Other than those you can do just about anything with Javascript objects.  Have fun!

          <p>Here we assign a value "Sicilian" to pizza:
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="color: blue">var</span> pizza = <span style="color: green">"Sicilian"</span>;
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="color: blue">var</span> pizza = { style: <span style="color: green">"Chicago"</span>, topping1: <span style="color: green">"pepperoni"</span>; topping2: <span style="color: green">"black olives"</span> };
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            pizza.topping1
            <br>
            pizza[topping1]
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="color: blue">var</span> pizza = { style: <span style="color: green">"Chicago"</span>, topping1: <span style="color: green">"pepperoni"</span>; topping2: <span style="color: green">"black olives"</span>; placeOrder() };
