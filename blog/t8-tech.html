      <div id="thoughts">Stop and listen.  Do you hear that?  It's the sound of all of your private information being sold to the highest bidder! No? Ok well I was just trying to prove a point, badly.  Our lives are information now.  We spend an increasingly larger amount of time each year connecting to the internet.  Every single day billions and billions of data transactions speed their way around cyber space (I feel old just saying that).  A major underlying issue with all of that data is security, and just how do we keep our data private?
      <br>
      <br>
      Whether it be your phone number stored in Facebook, or the credit card numbers of thousands of PlayStation users, we submit a lot of our personal data on the internet.The majority of hacking is visited upon web users through drive-by-downloading (convincing the user to download malicious software) or by attempting to gain access to a corporation's servers.
      <br>
      <br>
      The primary source of security flaws comes from web applications be subjected to cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL-injection attacks.  These attacks are possible through flawed coding and the failure to ensure that the data passed to and from web applications is free of malicious code. An XSS attack takes advantage of client-side scripting by injecting the hackers code into the html that the victim uses.  These typically allow a hacker to bypass user security controls.  An SQL-injection attack uses code injection to get by the filters in an SQL database.  Malicious code is inserted into an input field and the failing SQL security in a website gives the hackers access to the database.
      <br>
      <br>
      There's also another very popular type of security threat called 'phishing', where a thief will assume a false identity and convince the user to send their financial details and personal identification numbers to them through email.  There's even a Futurama movie about it.  I'm sure you've all seen an email about you winning the African National Lottery.  You didn't?  Well your great Aunt's cousin died last July in Lesotho and he had a winning lottery ticket. So you all you need to do is give me your social security number and your bank account number and password and I'll send you the money.  It's great right?!  You'll see all of your money leave your account and then you'll see a deposit of eleventy billion dollars shortly thereafter.

      The most recently publicized attack was over the Christmas holiday, 2014.  A group calling themselves the "Lizard Squad" implemented a DDOS attack on the PlayStation Network.  A DDOS is a directed denial of service attack.  Such attacks are intended to disrupt the use of a network so that its users cannot access the features.  In this case, no one was able to use the PlayStation network to play video games online, or update their game files, or in some cases use video streaming services like Netflix or Hulu.
      <br>
      <br>
      A DDOS attack is usually perpetrated through overwhelming a server with requests for access/information.  The overwhelmed server cannot respond to further input and is critically slowed and basically unavailable.
      <br>
      <br>
      The world of internet security is not something that many people think of on a daily basis; but it is of the highest importance on a constant basis.  There are companies all over the world that exist to provide internet security.  As our techonology/software advances the security has to try and stay current or we'll all be winning the African National Lottery.
