      <div id="thoughts">The saying goes that "there are no stupid questions."  This is true.  However, there are some pretty stupid ways to ask questions.  Many of these stupid ways can occur when inquiring about code.  There are a LOT of vague words and gray areas we use when we talk about code.  So how do we avoid these so we don't drag people down the bad question road?
      <br>
      <br>
      First, we need to make sure that we explain the background of our conundrum.  Make sure we include the details.  When dealing with coding problems, including even the smallest details can mean a quick answer that solves your problem.
      <br>
      <br>
      Second, make sure your question is clear, and well written.  Having bad grammar and poor choices of words will often illicit a tone in the answers that you didn't expect or want.  Good grammar is wonderful!

      Next, stick around and offer extra information if it is asked of you.  If you didn't provide enough information it will almost always be asked of you. You see a lot of half answers on message boards that the original poster responds to because they didn't provide enough initial information.
      <br>
      <br>
      Lastly, make sure you give feedback. People really appreciate this.  You don't have to send them an edible cookie bouquet, but leaving positive feedback is necessary.
      <br>
      <br>
      Remember, when asking questions in person or on the internet, being clear and open is very important.   Be responsive to feedback and you'll get the help you need.
