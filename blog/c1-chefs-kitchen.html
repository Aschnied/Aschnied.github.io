      <div id="thoughts">Today I watched a video from one of the founders of Dev Bootcamp, Shereef.  He basically went into the core principles of DBC and what a new attendee expects from the program will greatly determine their success.
      <br>
      <br>
      Is my attitude focused on my purchase of DBC education, then presuming what the outcome of that purchase is?
      <br>
      <br>
      Or am I going in with an open head, expecting to learn more than just coding?
      <br>
      <br>
      After my initial understanding of DBC values and concepts, I confess I was a bit worried.  In my past I have shied away from people who have wanted me to really focus on how my brain works.  I really took to heart what Shereef said about going into DBC and letting the experience change me for the better.  I'm going to let my guards down (they haven't had a day off in 27 years) and really embrace the DBC culture to provide myself and others the best environment to learn in.
      <br>
      <br>
      I am definitely nervous to become a part of such a large and diverse group of people. I hope that I can always give 100% compassion and understanding to everyone.
      <br>
      <br>
      So let's hear it for my first week of Phase 0.  I have been working towards this for a long time now and I hope for the continued support of my friends, family, and fellow Squirrels.</div>
