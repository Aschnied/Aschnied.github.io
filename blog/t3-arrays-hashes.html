      <div id="thoughts">Hello Again!  How was your week?  Mine was pretty interesting, with all the learning about Ruby methods, and the ways we store our information in Ruby.
      <br>
      <br>
      So what's the difference between arrays and hashes?  They both perform somewhat similar roles but the kinds of information we store in them is different.
      <br>
      <br>
      First off, in terms of simplicity and alphabetic order, arrays are useful when you want to store similar kinds of information into a list.  Names, your favorite foods, numbers, etc..; those all fit nicely into arrays.  Later on, you can write methods that reference to those arrays.  An array will even assign each object a position number so that you can easily reference them, or sort them as you wish.  Have a look:
      <br>
      <br>
      favorite_books = ["Harry Potter", "The Phone Book", "A Denny's Menu"]
      <br>
      <br>
      We just made an array.  Woohoo!  So what's a Hash?
      <br>
      <br>
      Hashes are great ways to store information that don't have much in common.  Pizza, Dogs, Being An Adult. Information in a hash won't be in an ordered list, so we can assign any object to refer to a spot in a hash. So what do we do when we need to reference that information but it's not in the same category.We create a hash!
      <br>
      <br>
      my_Hash = { "dogs" => "the best", "pizza" => "great", "being an adult" => "THE WORST"}
      <br>
      <br>
      Later on, we can use 'dogs', 'pizza', and 'being an adult' to point to their corresponding values.  Pretty awesome, right?</div>
