      <div id="thoughts">The way in which we handle conflict is a good indicator of our maturity.  We know that children will behave badly, stamping their feet, screaming and crying.  Adults though, we aren't supposed to do those things.  Just because we know better than children doesn't mean that we handle conflict well.

      I consider myself to be pretty decent at handling conflict. I know that during intense conflict involving people we know well, that I benefit from taking a half hour of time by myself to collect my thoughts.  Usually in that time I find the answer, and if I don't I find the serenity to accept that conflict happens for a reason. I try to find the lesson to be learned.

      For example, recently I have had a conflict involving my mother.  Our political views are drastically different.  I actually grew up in a home with an almost constant degree of verbal conflict.  Obviously conflict resolution skills weren't too developed in my home, but I digress.  My mother started going off on a tanget about some perceived crisis and I mistakenly interacted with a counterpoint.  After several minutes of argument, I gathered my wits and told my mother that it's best we do not talk about politics and I changed the subject to her grandchildren. It worked.  The issue was not resolved but I know that issue never will be.

      During the argument I felt a sense of betrayal, that the things my parents led me to believe weren't true.  I also felt anger that someone I loved so much could be so fooled by obvious propaganda.  I also felt pity that I couldn't do anything to sway her opinions.
      <br>
      <br>
      By just taking a step back and looking at the situation, its causes and effects, I felt a sense of accomplishment.  It took me years to get to the point of actively avoiding conflict with my mother.  The end result of that is a much friendlier relationship.

      I'm a person of action in conflict.  I told my mother that despite what each of us believes, neither will ever convince the other so we should just chalk it up to a draw. Some believe all actions that solve conflicts are decisive and clear; but often the solution to a conflict is admitting the lack of solution, and calling for an end to hostilities because neither side is correct, or able to win.
      <br>
      <br>
      If I could go back, I would quickly change the subject so that politics doesn't even come up.  Part of learning to handle conflict well is learning the signs of oncoming conflict.  If you get rained on enough you'll nknow what to look for before it rains.
