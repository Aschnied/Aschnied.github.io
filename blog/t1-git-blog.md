    This is my Phase 0 blog jam, go with it.


    Hey Newbs!


    Let's talk about version control for a bit.  Working as a group on a project can either go smoothly, or not at       all.  In a the programming world, groups work together often and need to have access to the same information even     though they're not sitting near each other and working on the same task.

    Verson control is how a group manages the changes each person is making in a larger project.  Github.com is a        website that allows multiple users access to a file, and each of them can make their changes and add them to the     file.

    The changes are tracked, and when something goes wrong the project can easily be reverted to a previous version.

    Github and git are useful tools to help a person or group keep track of all the changes.  Each person can take a     copy of the master file, and create their own to editin their own repository.  Git will allow the user to make       the changes and send them to the master file or vice versa. Programmers always add comments to their work, and       those comments are reflected on github. Changes aren't always a good thing, and git will help you in case an         added change messes up your file.  You can revert to  a version that didn't include the mistakes.  It's basically     time travel.

    Having Github store your code allows others to view your code and help you.  It also allows users to share their     code with others.

    So Github not only helps you manage your code, but it allows other people to help you;  which is really good.
