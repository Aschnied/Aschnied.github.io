      <div id="thoughts">Awhile back I took a quiz to determine my thinking style, and while I had no expectations on results, what I learned surprised me.
      <br>
      <br>
      Of the four thinking styles (Concrete Sequential, Abstract Sequential, Concrete Random, Abstract Random) my quiz results informed me that I lean towards a Concrete Sequential/Abstract Random hybrid.  So what does that mean?
      <br>
      <br>
      In the most basic sense it means that I like order and social harmony.  Yeah, that's pretty much right.
      <br>
      <br>
      How does this apply to DBC? Proper application of this knowledge means that I should try to document and organize as much of my experience and learning as possible, while engaging other students and staff to create a positive, social environment where information sharing is Actionable, Specific, and Kind.
      <br>
      <br>
      Now for Mindsets.
      <br>
      <br>
      In my opinion, one should really strive to have an open, growth mindset.  I think that if I really focus on my learning styles that I can figure out the best way to ensure my brain stays in a growth mindset.
      <br>
      <br>
      A growth mindset is a mental state where you believe that anyone can be and achieve anything.  When I apply what I've learned about my thinking style I can ensure that my mindset stays in a growth state.  To practically do this, I need to focus on my personal documentation and notes.  Seeing and writing is essential for me.  The more I can visual text, wireframes, and examples the more I can gain a better working knowledge of the concepts I'll need to master.
