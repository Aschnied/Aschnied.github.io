      <div id="thoughts">When creating an HTML document and assigning objects with either a "class" or and "id" it helps to think about what the object is.Is the object unique? Or is it one in a category of other objects like it?
      <br>
      <br>
      If the object is common, such line in a list, it is best to use the "class" identifier.  That means that there are other objects like it, and you can attack the "class" identifier to them as well.
      This allows for CSS styling across the entire class simultaneously.  It saves web developers a great deal of time.
      <br>
      <br>
      If the object is unique, then the "id" identifier is used.  There are often objects that are only used once on a page, or distinction needs to be made between two objects that are alike.  "Id" is used to modify each object by itself in CSS so that the other objects like it are not affected.
