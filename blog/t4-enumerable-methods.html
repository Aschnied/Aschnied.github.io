      <div id="thoughts">I know the majority of people reading this are already aware of what Ruby is, and all the fun things it does. The same goes for arrays, hashes, methods, etc.  I bet all of you even know what .map does.  Well, for those of you that have never seen .map before (among other things) I'll explain it.
      <br>
      <br>
      When we want to save information of a specific kind in Ruby, we put it into an array.  Once we have an array set up we can do a lot of things to it.  Let's say we have an array of numbers that represent ages.  Much later on we need to add 4 years to all of those ages because we forgot to for the last 3 years (whoops :/). .map is a fantastic way of going through an array and modifying each element in the array by a set standard.

      So we see that .map is pretty handy, right?  It can be used in a variety of ways, all achieving the same intention of modifying the elements in an array.
