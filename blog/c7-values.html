      <div id="thoughts">This weeks cultural topic is pretty vague: 'Values'.  Hmm, well yeah we all value different things.  I value pizza.  Other people might value not currently being engulfed in flames.  What I'm going to talk about today is the values in my life I've tried to exemplify.
      <br>
      <br>
      I was instructed to look at the following list of values and pick some that I try to live up to.

      Well I didn't see pizza on there so I went with the 3 values that I most valued (so meta!)  I chose Leadership, Efficiency, and Wisdom.  Why those? I'm a very social person. I drift naturally into leadership roles, I'm not one for wasting time, and I've been told that I'm full of pretty decent advice.
      <br>
      <br>
      The real test is: Have I been trying to living up to these values? On an agreement scale of 1-5 (with 5 being Yes) I'll say that:
      <br>
      Leadership gets a 4
      <br>
      Reputation gets a 5
      <br>
      Wisdom gets a 3
      <br>
      <br>
      I chose Leadership as my first value due my knowledge that it is a difficult value to live up to.  Being a leader means you are responsible for more than just yourself.  What you do is now in a spotlight where many people will be forming opinions based on your actions or inactions.  It's a lot to think about.
      <br>
      <br>
      I have friends that often as me for advice about re-organzing, or just managing. Make things more efficient is kind of my thing.  I have some friends that opened a coffee roasting company, and I like to think that without my advice in workflow management they'd be in a tough place.  I'm not saying I saved the day, or that they couldn't have done it themselves; but I have a knack for organizing people and objects.
      <br>
      <br>
      If you remember last week I wrote of Stereotype Threat.  I know that there aren't many openly gay leaders in the world.  Placing value in leadership and exemplifying it as much as I can can help calm threats of stereotyping myself as just a gay man with no ability to be a leader.  I know that I can overcome stereotype threat by being cognizant of them, and keeping true to my values.
