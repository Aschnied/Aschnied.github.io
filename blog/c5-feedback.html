      <div id="thoughts">Something a lot of the people in my personal life don't know about Dev Bootcamp is that we work with each other and give each other a LOT of feedback.  Not like "Hey, nice work today," but we give each other feedback each time we pair, and that happens a lot each week.  We also grade feedback randomly through a feedback site.  So the feedback that I give actually gets its own feedback.  Yup, we're thorough.

      Pairing
      <br>
      <br>
      A primary component of the Phase 0 process is pairing with other cohort members to solve challenges.  I engage in this at least 4 times a week. I enjoy pairing with others on the challenges because at times I know that it would take a long time to come up with a solution on my own.  With another person there it cuts several hours off my process and the pairing partner helps me to fill in the gaps in my knowledge.  Working with someone else going through the same process is invaluable.
      <br>
      <br>
      When pairing, one of us is supposed to be the driver and the navigator.  The only thing frustrating is that I find myself unexperienced enough that if I'm just driving or navigating I feel that I'm not up-to-par with my partner's skills.  This leads us to deviate from the driver/navigator structure and that worries me that I'm not completing the pairing challenges in the way that Dev Bootcamp expects.

      Feedback
      <br>
      <br>
      I feel fine with the feedback I have received.  I know that I have room to grow and learn and my cohort has been very kind about that.  The feedback has also been very helpful in informing me of the unconscious things like apologizing for not knowing an answer; and just being aware of that is very helpful.
      <br>
      <br>
      Based on the feedback I have received I know that showing up prepared with my Pseudocode is really helpful and I that is a strategy I need to employ every time I pair.  Some of the challenges inform us that we aren't to look at the challenge until we pair, but I found that even just writing out a rough outline of the Ruby material we covered this week is very helpful in terms of my learning style.
      <br>
      <br>
      I have not felt difficulty in writing feedback for others, but some of my feedback has been strongly disagreed with.  I guess that means I really need to be more eloquent about the feedback I leave; which until this point I did not know that was difficulty I had.
      <br>
      <br>
      All in all, pairing and feedback is a profoundly beneficial to the Phase 0 process.  If it was not in place I can't even imagine getting through all of the course material on my own.
